# Authentication Setup Instructions

Your MERN Inventory Management System now has complete authentication! Here's what was added:

## 🔐 What's New

### Backend Changes:
- **JWT Authentication** with login/register endpoints
- **Password encryption** using bcryptjs
- **User model** for storing user credentials
- **Protected routes** - all product operations now require authentication
- **Middleware** for verifying JWT tokens

### Frontend Changes:
- **Login/Register page** with beautiful UI
- **Authentication Context** for managing user state
- **Protected Routes** - users must login to access the app
- **Updated Navbar** with user welcome message and logout
- **API calls updated** to include authentication headers

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Start Backend:
```bash
cd Backend
npm install
npm run server
```

### 2. Start Frontend:
```bash
cd Frontend/inventory_management_system
npm start
```

## 🔑 How Authentication Works

1. **First Time Users**: Will see the login page with option to create account
2. **Registration**: Users can create account with name, email, and password (minimum 5 characters)
3. **Login**: Existing users can login with email and password
4. **Auto-login**: If user has valid token, they'll be automatically logged in
5. **Session Management**: Login persists until user logs out
6. **Protection**: All product operations require valid authentication

## 📝 Default Test User

Since this is a new setup, you'll need to create your first user account through the registration form.

## 🎨 Features

- **Beautiful Login UI** with animations and gradients
- **Form Validation** with error messages
- **Loading states** for better UX
- **Responsive Design** works on all devices
- **Secure Authentication** with JWT tokens
- **Automatic token refresh** when user returns

## 🔧 Security Notes

- Passwords are encrypted using bcryptjs
- JWT tokens are stored in localStorage
- All API endpoints are protected
- Token verification on every request
- Automatic logout on token expiry

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Start both backend and frontend servers
2. Navigate to the frontend URL (usually http://localhost:3000)
3. Create your first admin account
4. Start managing your inventory!

Enjoy your new authenticated inventory management system! 🎉
